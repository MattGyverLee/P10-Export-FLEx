So, here's the plan. https://github.com/rmlockwood/FLExTrans/ has functionality (mostly ImportFromParatext.py and ChapterSelection.py)  to pull Bible chapters or books from Paratext 9 (Source Code is closed) into a Fieldworks (https://github.com/sillsdev/FieldWorks) (C#) project as texts using a C# API library called LibLCM https://github.com/sillsdev/liblcm .  Paratext 10 (https://github.com/paranext/paranext-core) has a different architecture (Typescript) from the ground up and allows plugins (which can be bootstrapped https://github.com/beniza/create-paranext-extension/tree/main). The Eventual goal is to create a User-facing Paratext 10 plugin that can send chapters or books cleanly to Flex texts for analysis and use in another took FLExTrans (https://github.com/rmlockwood/FLExTrans/). The document Discussion.md contains my notes from the conversation with my supervisor discussing MVP and future plans. What do you need from me to make a plan?

1. I have experience calling LibLCM from python, not TS. The LibLCM .dll will be on the machine and accessible. I was under the impression we could call it with IPC without adding further C# libraries.
2. Yes and Yes. I used https://github.com/beniza/create-paranext-extension/tree/main to build a bootstrapped plugin that would compile and work, but it had no content.
3. The Pre-MVP should start by proving that I can read a whole book (it is one file in Paratext) into the plugin. That's the first hurdle. The real MVP will "push" books and chapters into FLEx. There's a lot of filtering happening in the current FLexTools process that will need to be mirrored/improved. I don't know if Paratext will give me access to SFM text files, or something more structured like USX XML. Yes, No cluster settings, and Windows only.
4. I believe you can query available projects through LibLCM. This is something that FlexTrans does via APIs, but I don't know how.
5. For the moment, we will side-load it. Distribution is a battle for another day.
6. https://github.com/rmlockwood/FLExTrans/blob/28c45d2f3ddbd71da2e256415956e9cbef8b5ec5/Dev/Modules/ImportFromParatext.py#L4
and https://github.com/rmlockwood/FLExTrans/blob/28c45d2f3ddbd71da2e256415956e9cbef8b5ec5/Dev/Lib/ChapterSelection.py#L4

If you need local copies of any of these codebases/libraries for reference, you can find the Paranext code here: D:\Github\paranext-core,  liblcm here D:\Github\liblcm, and D:\Github\flextools here. The repositories in my forks may be stale and need to be updated from the origin.FlexTrans is now here D:\Github\FLExTrans  the Extension bootstrap is here: D:\Github\paranextPlugin\create-paranetxt-extension but it may need to be updated from upstream.
